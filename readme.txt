Let’s Rally Interview Coding Challenge

Objective:
Bob is the owner of Palm Landscaping Services. Services provided are plant trimming, leaf and garbage pickup, dead plant replacement and weed spraying. In addition to performing these services himself, Bob uses subcontractors to help him cover all of his customers.
Recently, Bob’s had problems with subcontractors charging him for work that they did not do.
Help Bob create a simple application that he can use to ensure that his subcontractors are completing their jobs.

Requirements:
1) Bob needs recorded proof of completed work per site, per visit.
2) Bob needs to know how long a subcontractor is spending at each job site.
3) Bob needs to a visual graph of the work being completed per job site over time to
ensure that all services are being performed routinely.

Bonus points (​As code included in final deliverable or as a written summary):
1) What additional data points should Bob be paying attention to as indicators of
contractor performance?
2) How can Bob use this application to market his services to new clients?
3) How can Bob use this application to present value to his existing clients?
4) What technology(s) can be leveraged to further eliminate opportunities for fraudulent
charges?



1)	Bob could be paying attention to time spent at each job in order to make sure his contractors are not
	wasting time. He could also look to jobs per day, and could include a customer satisfaction index
	to gauge the actual work being completed by the contractors.

2)	Bob can show this application to prospective clients as a way to guarantee satisfaction and efficiency.
	The application itself will be beneficial in allowing Bob to make sure the best contractors are getting
	more jobs, and will comfort the customer in guaranteeing work is completed in an appropriate amount of time

3)	He can show his existing clients that the most efficient subcontractors will be used for more jobs, which 
	gives them more value, and also if he includes the customer satisfaction index, he can show them that any
	issues will be able to be addressed more quickly and effectively.

4)	In the future, Bob can include GPS location services, so that he can verify the location of a contractor when 
	they check into the job, and also a signature option for customers to verify work is completed, although
	I believe a PIN is more secure due to potential forgery.
